# Shellshock Vulnerability


This script will detect and exploit the Shellshock Vulnerability. 
Shellshock Vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on a targeted system, giving them full control of the machine.

The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the way Bash processes environment variables. An attacker can exploit this flaw by passing specially crafted environment variables to a vulnerable version of Bash.

The impact of the Shellshock vulnerability is significant because Bash is widely used on Unix-based systems, including Linux and macOS. It allows attackers to gain control of servers, steal data, and launch attacks on other systems.
